        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
         <h2>Introduction (Point: ML is incredibly powerful/useful)</h2>
        <ul>

<li>Point
<ul>
<li>
 Machine Learning is very broadly useful and core to AI because it allows programs to learn and adapt appropriately to new input without hardcoding its behavior
</li>
<li>
But to work, developers need to give it a lot of the right kind of data
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Illustration
<ul>
<li>
 Black Box Models: Machine Learning Algorithms discern patterns in data that would be difficult or impossible to code explicitly
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Explanation
<ul>
<li>
ML models can then make accurate predictions, approriate decision or novel insights when confronted with new data, without anyone knowing how exactly.
</li>
<li>
ML makes large amounts of data much more useful and valuable to us
</li>
</ul>

            <h2>Examples (Illustration: Some of the many uses. ML pops up in many new disruptive technologies)</h2>

<b>Examples graphic</b>

<ul>

<li>Point
<ul>
<li>
 Autonomous Vehicle technology is a very useful application of ML
</li>
<li>
ML is well suited to the problem of object recognition needed for autonomous vehicles
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Illustration
<ul>
<li>
 Object recognition for Autonomous Vehicles is very hard, must be accurate and must be appropriate to the task ie. vehicles, pedestrians, street signs etc.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Explanation
<ul>
<li>
With ML, object recognition models can be trained, tested and improved through trial and error by inputing more data and correcting mistakes.
</li>
<li>
Eventually, an accurate and robust object recognition model can be created without having to explicitly account for all possible circumstances/parameters on the road
</li>
</ul>

        <h2>THE EFFECTS ON THE JOB MARKET</h2>
            <h3>IMPACT ON THE WORKFORCE</h3>
            <p>
            The rapid increase in emerging technologies suggests that they are having a substantial impact on the workforce. 
            </p>
            <p>For example,Derek Thompson writes that “Google is worth $370 billion but has only about 55,000 employees – less than a tenth the size of ATandT’s workforce in its heyday [in the 1960s].<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/">The Atlantic</a>
            </p>  
            <p>According to economist Andrew McAfee, “we are facing
            a time when machines will replace people for most of the jobs in the current economy, and I believe it will come not in the crazy distant future.”

            <h3>IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC POLICY</h3>
            <p>
            Advanced societies are at a major turning point in terms of how we think about work, leisure, and social benefit delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
            Advanced economies need fewer workers to complete needed tasks, and benefits are delivered mainly through full-time jobs, there is a danger that many people will have difficulties getting health care, pensions, and the income maintenance they need to sustain their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
             When a considerable portion of human labor no longer is necessary to run the economy, we have to rethink income generation, employment, and public policy. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/robotwork.pdf">Brrokings Article</a>
