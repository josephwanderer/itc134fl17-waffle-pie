            Whether it is an inquisitive social media data mine generating anticipation of your next google search with an ad banner or Advanced Neural Networks running competing sets of metaheuristic genetic <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123983640000012">www.sciencedirect.com</a> algorithms optimizing design of components for <a href="http://www.airbus.com/newsroom/news/en/2016/03/Pioneering-bionic-3D-printing.html">aircraft</a> or next generation medical implant, to how decisions are arrived at in <a href="http://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(17)31442-7/fulltext">emergency rooms</a>, machine learning is influencing the material world in ways that are startling to comprehend given the near infancy of the technology.

            It is easy to get all Phillip K. Dick about it and accept the dominance of our Ai overlords...but then, funny enough, an automaton programed with a  natural language algorithm programmed with the works of Phillip k. Dick and his letters as a dataset ca do it for you. <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Workshops/2005/WS-05-11/WS05-11-005.pdf">www.aaai.org</a> A google search of the news blurb that made the rounds in 2015 turns up a huge % of the daily publications in the english language picking up the story of one of David Hanson's uncanny valley spanning automatons telling (it)'s creator that (it) would keep, him especially, "in a human zoo".  Science Fiction's predisposition to pessimistic dystopia will not dispel how much fun it is to watch the semi rational algorithm learn to walk and then run almost exactly like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=110&v=gn4nRCC9TwQ">Jack Sparrow</a>.

            Some care will have to be taken to not let machine learning run away from us, <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/superintelligence.htmlprediction">Nick Bostrom's</a> of a Superintelligent Ai emergence within the first third of the 21st century is fast closing and already we have seen reprecussions of too much faith being put in an algorithm to operate in our interest autonomously.  The 2010 <a href= "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/07/business/economy/07trade.html">glitch</a> in a high speed trading algorithm that forced a shutdown of the New York Stock Exchange is far enough in the rear view that automated trading accounts for between 50% and 75% of buying and selling on the <a href="https://qz.com/1078602/why-the-new-york-stock-exchange-nyse-still-has-human-brokers-on-the-trading-floor/">trading floor</a> today.

        As impressive as the object recognition capacity of the machine learning that has informed the progress of autonomous vehicles, there are still thorny questions regarding the morality of life and death decisions that will likely be put before said vehicle operatiing in the chaos of the open road, will an ananomous pedestrian be struck to save the vehicle occupant from an oncoming truck?<a href="http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2502&context=cmc_theses">scholarship.claremont.edu</a>

        That the implementation of machine learning can not only supplant but surpass human interaction and increasingly, human imagination is not something many proud humans are willing to concede. Yet
        for the sake of convenience, we increasingly rely on it to answer problems of immediate concern. At this point we all just may be along for the ride, so it is best to understand the science driving the 
        advance of machine learning.
