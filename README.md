<h1>Machine Learning</h1>


<h2>Introduction (Point: ML is incredibly powerful/useful)</h2>

<ul>

<li>Point
<ul>
<li>
 Machine Learning is very broadly useful and core to AI because it allows programs to learn and adapt appropriately to new input without hardcoding its behavior
</li>
<li>
But to work, developers need to give it a lot of the right kind of data
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Illustration
<ul>
<li>
 Black Box Models: Machine Learning Algorithms discern patterns in data that would be difficult or impossible to code explicitly
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Explanation
<ul>
<li>
ML models can then make accurate predictions, approriate decision or novel insights when confronted with new data, without anyone knowing how exactly.
</li>
<li>
ML makes large amounts of data much more useful and valuable to us
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>


<h2>Examples (Illustration: Some of the many uses. ML pops up in many new disruptive technologies)</h2>

<b>Examples graphic</b>

<ul>

<li>Point
<ul>
<li>
 Autonomous Vehicle technology is a very useful application of ML
</li>
<li>
ML is well suited to the problem of object recognition needed for autonomous vehicles
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Illustration
<ul>
<li>
 Object recognition for Autonomous Vehicles is very hard, must be accurate and must be appropriate to the task ie. vehicles, pedestrians, street signs etc.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Explanation
<ul>
<li>
With ML, object recognition models can be trained, tested and improved through trial and error by inputing more data and correcting mistakes.
</li>
<li>
Eventually, an accurate and robust object recognition model can be created without having to explicitly account for all possible circumstances/parameters on the road
</li>
</ul>
