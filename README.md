<h1>Machine Learning</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<ul>

<li>Point
<ul>
<li>
 Machine Learning is very broadly useful and core to AI because it allows programs to learn and adapt appropriately to new input without hardcoding its behavior
</li>
<li>
But to work, developers need to give it a lot of the right kind of data</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Illustration
<ul>
<li>
 Black Box Models: Machine Learning Algorithms discern patterns in data that would be difficult or impossible to code explicitly
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Explanation
<ul>
<li>
ML models can then make accurate predictions or approriate decision when confronted with new data, without anyone knowing how exactly.
