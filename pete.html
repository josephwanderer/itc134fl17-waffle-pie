            <h3>IMPACT ON THE WORKFORCE</h3>
            <p>
            The rapid increase in emerging technologies suggests that they are having a substantial impact on the workforce. 
            </p>
            <p>For example,Derek Thompson writes that “Google is worth $370 billion but has only about 55,000 employees – less than a tenth the size of ATandT’s workforce in its heyday [in the 1960s].<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/">The Atlantic</a>
            </p>  
            <p>According to economist Andrew McAfee, “we are facing
            a time when machines will replace people for most of the jobs in the current economy, and I believe it will come not in the crazy distant future.”

            <h3>IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC POLICY</h3>
            <p>
            Advanced societies are at a major turning point in terms of how we think about work, leisure, and social benefit delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
            Advanced economies need fewer workers to complete needed tasks, and benefits are delivered mainly through full-time jobs, there is a danger that many people will have difficulties getting health care, pensions, and the income maintenance they need to sustain their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
             When a considerable portion of human labor no longer is necessary to run the economy, we have to rethink income generation, employment, and public policy. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/robotwork.pdf">Brrokings Article</a>
