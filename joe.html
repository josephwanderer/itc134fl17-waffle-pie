<h1>Machine Learning</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Machine learning is a core application of artificial intelligence (AI). It provides computers the ability to learn and adapt from existing experience automatically without hard coding. That is to say, given new data, the machine can make projections based on the pattern of data that has been learnt. Machine learning comes across complex mathematical calculations, data mining and deep learning. Complex mathematical calculations, such as singular value deposition and back-propagation, are often used to derive “black-box” models; data mining serves as the prerequisite of machine learning, since ML models stands on top of a deep understanding and discovery of data structure. However, the scope of data mining is limited to data that we know already, while machine learning develops models from these data and applies the models to new data and make predictions. In data analytics, the predictive power of machine learning allow data scientists, engineers and analysts to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and insights from historical relationships and trends in the data.</p>

<li>Point
<ul>
<li>
 Machine Learning is very broadly useful and core to AI because it allows programs to learn and adapt appropriately to new input without hardcoding its behavior
</li>
<li>
But to work, developers need to give it a lot of the right kind of data
</li>
</ul>

 Black Box Models: Machine Learning Algorithms discern patterns in data that would be difficult or impossible to code explicitly
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Explanation
<ul>
<li>
ML models can then make accurate predictions, approriate decision or novel insights when confronted with new data, without anyone knowing how exactly.
</li>
<li>
ML makes large amounts of data much more useful and valuable to us
