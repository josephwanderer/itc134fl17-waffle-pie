    <h2>Introduction</h2>

        Machine learning(ML) is a powerful technique in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) that promises to greatly expand the accuracy and usefuleness of AI.  It provides computers the ability to learn and adapt from existing experience automatically without hard coding. That is to say, given new data, the machine can make projections based on the patterns it has found in comparable data that it has been fed previously.

        The expansive and adaptive utility of ML based AI, ranging from autonomous vehicles to product design, has the potential to disrupt large swathes of the human labor market as we know it. Complex mathematical methods, such as singular value deposition and back-propagation, are often used to derive “black-box” models, which are models whose internal logic is too complicated or obscure for humans to understand comprehensively and therefore impossible for humans to code explicitly.

        Data mining is the foundation of machine learning, since ML models are built on top of a deep understanding and discovery of data structure. However, the scope of data mining by itself is limited to data that we know already, while machine learning develops models from these data and applies the models to new data to make predictions and decisions. Having more and better data with which to train ML models makes those models more robust, more accurate and more useful, which makes that data potentially very valuable. In data analytics, the predictive power of machine learning allows data scientists, engineers and analysts to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and insights from historical relationships and trends in the data, making such data again that much more valuable to them.
