<h1>Process of Machine Learning</h1>

	 <p>As we previously discussed Machine learning is the science of simulating the human mind and learning from past experiences in order to improve and develop through time and training. The point here is to create a model that give us most of the time correct predictions or answers. To create that model we need to follow 7 specific steps :</p>

<h2>1. Gathering Data</h2>
	<p>This is a critical step upon which all the process depend.This step is very important because the quality and quantity of data that we gather will directly determine how good the predictive model can be. Because data science is a vast field of practices aimed at extracting valuable observations from data in any form, qualified data decide the minimum prediction accuracy of the model.</p> 

<h2>2. Data Preparation</h2>
<p>In this step, we load the data that we gathered into a suitable place (Database, Excel sheet…) and prepare it for use in our machine learning training. An important thing to do in this stage is to randomize the ordering. We don’t want the order of the data to affect the training of the machine learning and its accuracy. Then we divide our gathered data into to sort of Datasets : <b>Training Dataset</b>: A dataset that we feed into our machine learning algorithm to train our model and <b>Testing Dataset</b>: A dataset that we use to validate the accuracy of our model but is not used to train the model. It may be called the validation dataset.</p>

<h2>3. Model Training</h2> 
	<p>There are many models that researchers and data scientists have created over the years. Some are very well suited for image data, others for sequences (like text, or music), some for numerical data, others for text-based data. Models are chosen according to the data that we gathered.<br>

	The training process involves using the training dataset and attempting to predict the output with those values. In the beginning, of course it does pretty poorly. But we can compare our model’s predictions with the output that it should produced, and adjust the values such that we will have more correct predictions. This process then repeats</p>

<h2>4. Evaluation</h2> 
	<p>The training is complete and now it’s time to see if the model is any good.This is where we are going to use the testing dataset. Evaluation allows us to test our model against data that has never been used for training. This allows us to see how the model might perform against data that it has not yet seen. Because that is how things are in the real world.</p>

<h2>5. Parameter Tuning and Predicting</h2> 
	<p>In this step, we want to see if we can further improve the training of the model by tuning some parameter that we assumed in the start of the training. Also, it is important to keep an eye in the learning rate of the model in order to keep track of our progres.<br>

	Predicting is the final step when we get the final result of the model predicting an answer for the primary problem that we posed in the beginning.
