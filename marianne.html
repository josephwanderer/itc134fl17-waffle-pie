<h1>Types of Machine Learning</h1>
	 <p>There are three primary types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning</a> methods:</p>

	 <ul>
 		<li>Supervised</li>
 		<li>unsupervised</li>
 		<li>semi-supervised (reinforcement learning)</li> 
	</ul>

	<p>All of these methods use an inter-changeable variety of algorithms for learning. </p>



<h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
	<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">Supervised Learning</a>, the examples are already modeled, and the algorithm predicts future data based off previous data.</p> 


<h3>How it works:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Classification criteria is defined during model building.  </li>
	<li>Clusters can be for any classification criteria (e.g.: shapes, colors, etc.)</li>
	<li>To separate and classify images of cars, colors are grouped into similar clusters by the algorithm.</li>
</ol>



<h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2> 
	<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning">Unsupervised Learning</a>, the algorithm knows nothing about the data, it is completely unmodeled at the start of learning. It is the job of the machine to separate the data into similar groups.</p>

	<p>This type of learning does not contain any outcome variables to predict.</p>


<h3>How it works:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Classificaiton criteria is emergent.</li>
		<li>To separate the cars by big and small, the computer would iteratively improve its matching algorithm without any interference from a human.</li>
	</ol>

<h2>Semi-supervised / Reinforcement learning</h2>
 
 <p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning">Semi-supervised Learning</a>, the data is mixed (some labeled, some unlabeled). This type of learning is used to improve learning accuracy without the processor cost of Unsupervised Learning. </p>

<h3>How it works:</h3>
	<ol>
	 <li>These algorithms use a mixture of supervised and unsupervised learning.</li>
	 <li>This type of learning is used to model using production data (with a subset of data used for training; and the remaining for actual model predictions)</li>
	</ol>




<h1>Mechanism Behind Machine Learning</h1>

<h2>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)</h2>
	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">Artificial Neural Networks</a> are learning systems that mimic the human neural networks. Using artificial neurons, machines can use labeled images to help identify like objects in other images.

<h1>Types of Machine Learning Activities</h1>


<h2>Classification Algorithms</h2>
	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">Classification algorithms</a> include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">Logistic Regression</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">Support Vector Machines</a> (SVM). They are used for things such as spam detection, text labeling, and diabetes diagnosis.   </p>

	<p><b>Most common use:</b> Supervised Learning</p>

<h2>Regression Algorithms</h2>
	<p><a href="https://medium.com/simple-ai/linear-regression-intro-to-machine-learning-6-6e320dbdaf06">Regression Algorithms</a> include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression">Linear Regression</a>. The are used for things such as predicting prices of an item based on its size or weight. </p>

	<p><b>Most common use:</b> Supervised Learning</p>


<h2>Clustering Algorithms</h2>
	<p>Clustering Algorithms include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">K-means</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_class_model">Latent Class Analysis</a> (LCA) are used for things such as grouping customers into different market segmentation. </p>

	<p><b>Most common use:</b> Unsupervised Learning</p>


<h2>Collaborative Filtering Algorithms</h2>
	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering">Collaborative Filtering</a> algorithms include <a href="https://bugra.github.io/work/notes/2014-04-19/alternating-least-squares-method-for-collaborative-filtering/">Alternating Least Squares</a> (ALS). These are behind most e-commerce <a hef="https://blog.statsbot.co/recommendation-system-algorithms-ba67f39ac9a3">recommender systems</a>. These algorithms are used for product recommendations for providers like Netflix or Amazon. </p>

	<p>These type of algorithms take information from like minded individuals. So say you tend to like the same movies as another individual, this algorithm will suggest movies from that other individual and vice versa.</p>

	<p><b>Most common use:</b> Unsupervised Learning</p>

<h2>Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms</h2>
	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction">Dimensionality Reduction</a>algorithms include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">Principal Component Analysis</a> (PCA). These are used for removing redundant variables in data.</p>

	<p><b>Most common use:</b> Unsupervised Learning</p>
